Members shall give effect to the provisions of this Agreement. Members may, but shall not be obliged to, implement in their law more extensive protection than is required by this Agreement, provided that such protection does not contravene the provisions of this Agreement.

Any Member availing itself of the possibilities provided in paragraph 3 of Article 5 or paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the Rome Convention shall make a notification as foreseen in those provisions to the Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the &#8220;Council for TRIPS&#8221;).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 2<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Intellectual Property Conventions<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">1.

In respect of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations, this obligation only applies in respect of the rights provided under this Agreement.

A Member shall be excepted from this obligation in respect of cinematographic works unless such rental has led to widespread copying of such works which is materially impairing the exclusive right of reproduction conferred in that Member on authors and their successors in title. In respect of computer programs, this obligation does not apply to rentals where the program itself is not the essential object of the rental.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 12<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Term of Protection<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whenever the term of protection of a work, other than a photographic work or a work of applied art, is calculated on a basis other than the life of a natural person, such term shall be no less than 50 years from the end of the calendar year of authorized publication, or, failing such authorized publication within 50 years from the making of the work, 50 years from the end of the calendar year of making.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 13<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Limitations and Exceptions<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Members shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 14<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">(Sound Recordings) and Broadcasting Organizations<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. In respect of a fixation of their performance on a phonogram, performers shall have the possibility of preventing the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation of their unfixed performance and the reproduction of such fixation. Performers shall also have the possibility of preventing the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the broadcasting by wireless means and the communication to the public of their live performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. Producers of phonograms shall enjoy the right to authorize or prohibit the direct or indirect reproduction of their phonograms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3. Broadcasting organizations shall have the right to prohibit the following acts when undertaken without their authorization: the fixation, the reproduction of fixations, and the rebroadcasting by wireless means of broadcasts, as well as the communication to the public of television broadcasts of the same. Where Members do not grant such rights to broadcasting organizations, they shall provide owners of copyright in the subject matter of broadcasts with the possibility of preventing the above acts, subject to the provisions of the Berne Convention (1971).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. The provisions of Article 11 in respect of computer programs shall apply mutatis mutandis to producers of phonograms and any other right holders in phonograms as determined in a Member&#8217;s law. If on 15 April 1994 a Member has in force a system of equitable remuneration of right holders in respect of the rental of phonograms, it may maintain such system provided that the commercial rental of phonograms is not giving rise to the material impairment of the exclusive rights of reproduction of right holders.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">5. The term of the protection available under this Agreement to performers and producers of phonograms shall last at least until the end of a period of 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the fixation was made or the performance took place. The term of protection granted pursuant to paragraph 3 shall last for at least 20 years from the end of the calendar year in which the broadcast took place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">6. Any Member may, in relation to the rights conferred under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, provide for conditions, limitations, exceptions and reservations to the extent permitted by the Rome Convention.

Any sign, or any combination of signs, capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings, shall be capable of constituting a trademark. Such signs, in particular words including personal names, letters, numerals, figurative elements and combinations of colours as well as any combination of such signs, shall be eligible for registration as trademarks. Where signs are not inherently capable of distinguishing the relevant goods or services, Members may make registrability depend on distinctiveness acquired through use. Members may require, as a condition of registration, that signs be visually perceptible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. Paragraph 1 shall not be understood to prevent a Member from denying registration of a trademark on other grounds, provided that they do not derogate from the provisions of the Paris Convention (1967).<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3. Members may make registrability depend on use. However, actual use of a trademark shall not be a condition for filing an application for registration. An application shall not be refused solely on the ground that intended use has not taken place before the expiry of a period of three years from the date of application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. The nature of the goods or services to which a trademark is to be applied shall in no case form an obstacle to registration of the trademark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">5. Members shall publish each trademark either before it is registered or promptly after it is registered and shall afford a reasonable opportunity for petitions to cancel the registration.

The owner of a registered trademark shall have the exclusive right to prevent all third parties not having the owner\u2019s consent from using in the course of trade identical or similar signs for goods or services which are identical or similar to those in respect of which the trademark is registered where such use would result in a likelihood of confusion. In case of the use of an identical sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed. The rights described above shall not prejudice any existing prior rights, nor shall they affect the possibility of Members making rights available on the basis of use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention (1967) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to services. In determining whether a trademark is well-known, Members shall take account of the knowledge of the trademark in the relevant sector of the public, including knowledge in the Member concerned which has been obtained as a result of the promotion of the trademark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3. Article 6bis of the Paris Convention (1967) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to goods or services which are not similar to those in respect of which a trademark is registered, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the registered trademark and provided that the interests of the owner of the registered trademark are likely to be damaged by such use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 17<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Exceptions<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Members may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that such exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the owner of the trademark and of third parties.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 18<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Term of Protection<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Initial registration, and each renewal of registration, of a trademark shall be for a term of no less than seven years.

If use is required to maintain a registration, the registration may be cancelled only after an uninterrupted period of at least three years of non-use, unless valid reasons based on the existence of obstacles to such use are shown by the trademark owner. Circumstances arising independently of the will of the owner of the trademark which constitute an obstacle to the use of the trademark, such as import restrictions on or other government requirements for goods or services protected by the trademark, shall be recognized as valid reasons for non-use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. When subject to the control of its owner, use of a trademark by another person shall be recognized as use of the trademark for the purpose of maintaining the registration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 20<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Other Requirements<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The use of a trademark in the course of trade shall not be unjustifiably encumbered by special requirements, such as use with another trademark, use in a special form or use in a manner detrimental to its capability to distinguish the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. This will not preclude a requirement prescribing the use of the trademark identifying the undertaking producing the goods or services along with, but without linking it to, the trademark distinguishing the specific goods or services in question of that undertaking.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 21<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Licensing and Assignment<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Members may determine conditions on the licensing and assignment of trademarks, it being understood that the compulsory licensing of trademarks shall not be permitted and that the owner of a registered trademark shall have the right to assign the trademark with or without the transfer of the business to which the trademark belongs.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">SECTION 3: GEOGRAPHICAL INDICATIONS<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 22<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Protection of Geographical Indications<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1.

A Member shall, ex officio if its legislation so permits or at the request of an interested party, refuse or invalidate the registration of a trademark which contains or consists of a geographical indication with respect to goods not originating in the territory indicated, if use of the indication in the trademark for such goods in that Member is of such a nature as to mislead the public as to the true place of origin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. The protection under paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be applicable against a geographical indication which, although literally true as to the territory, region or locality in which the goods originate, falsely represents to the public that the goods originate in another territory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 23<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Additional Protection for Geographical Indications<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">for Wines and Spirits<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. Each Member shall provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent use of a geographical indication identifying wines for wines not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question or identifying spirits for spirits not originating in the place indicated by the geographical indication in question, even where the true origin of the goods is indicated or the geographical indication is used in translation or accompanied by expressions such as &#8220;kind&#8221;, &#8220;type&#8221;, &#8220;style&#8221;, &#8220;imitation&#8221; or the like.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. The registration of a trademark for wines which contains or consists of a geographical indication identifying wines or for spirits which contains or consists of a geographical indication identifying spirits shall be refused or invalidated, ex officio if a Member&#8217;s legislation so permits or at the request of an interested party, with respect to such wines or spirits not having this origin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3. In the case of homonymous geographical indications for wines, protection shall be accorded to each indication, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of Article 22. Each Member shall determine the practical conditions under which the homonymous indications in question will be differentiated from each other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the producers concerned and that consumers are not misled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. In order to facilitate the protection of geographical indications for wines, negotiations shall be undertaken in the Council for TRIPS concerning the establishment of a multilateral system of notification and registration of geographical indications for wines eligible for protection in those Members participating in the system.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 24<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">International Negotiations; Exceptions<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. Members agree to enter into negotiations aimed at increasing the protection of individual geographical indications under Article 23. The provisions of paragraphs 4 through 8 below shall not be used by a Member to refuse to conduct negotiations or to conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements. In the context of such negotiations, Members shall be willing to consider the continued applicability of these provisions to individual geographical indications whose use was the subject of such negotiations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. The Council for TRIPS shall keep under review the application of the provisions of this Section; the first such review shall take place within two years of the entry into force of the WTO Agreement. Any matter affecting the compliance with the obligations under these provisions may be drawn to the attention of the Council, which, at trequest of a Member, shall consult with any Member or Members in respect of such matter in respect of which it has not been possible to find a satisfactory solution through bilateral or plurilateral consultations between the Members concerned. The Council shall take such action as may be agreed to facilitate the operation and further the objectives of this Section.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3. In implementing this Section, a Member shall not diminish the protection of geographical indications that existed in that Member immediately prior to the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. Nothing in this Section shall require a Member to prevent continued and similar use of a particular geographical indication of another Member identifying wines or spirits in connection with goods or services by any of its nationals or domiciliaries who have used that geographical indication in a continuous manner with regard to the same or related goods or services in the territory of that Member either (a) for at least 10 years preceding 15 April 1994 or (b) in good faith preceding that date.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">5. Where a trademark has been applied for or registered in good faith, or where rights to a trademark have been acquired through use in good faith either:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">(a) before the date of application of these provisions in that Member as defined in Part VI; or<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">(b) before the geographical indication is protected in its country of origin; measures adopted to implement this Section shall not prejudice eligibility for or the validity of the registration of a trademark, or the right to use a trademark, on the basis that such a trademark is identical with, or similar to, a geographical indication.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">6. Nothing in this Section shall require a Member to apply its provisions in respect of a geographical indication of any other Member with respect to goods or services for which the relevant indication is identical with the term customary in common language as the common name for such goods or services in the territory of that Member. Nothing in this Section shall require a Member to apply its provisions in respect of a geographical indication of any other Member with respect to products of the vine for which the relevant indication is identical with the customary name of a grape variety existing in the territory of that Member as of the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">7. A Member may provide that any request made under this Section in connection with the use or registration of a trademark must be presented within five years after the adverse use of the protected indication has become generally known in that Member or after the date of registration of the trademark in that Member provided that the trademark has been published by that date, if such date is earlier than the date on which the adverse use became generally known in that Member, provided that the geographical indication is not used or registered in bad faith.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">8. The provisions of this Section shall in no way prejudice the right of any person to use, in the course of trade, that person\u2019s name or the name of that person\u2019s predecessor in business, except where such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">9. There shall be no obligation under this Agreement to protect geographical indications which are not or cease to be protected in their country of origin, or which have fallen into disuse in that country.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">SECTION 4: INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 25<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Requirements for Protection<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. Members shall provide for the protection of independently created industrial designs that are new or original. Members may provide that designs are not new or original if they do not significantly differ from known designs or combinations of known design features. Members may provide that such protection shall not extend to designs dictated essentially by technical or functional considerations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. Each Member shall ensure that requirements for securing protection for textile designs, in particular in regard to any cost, examination or publication, do not unreasonably impair the opportunity to seek and obtain such protection.

A Member whose nationals or domiciliaries are subject to proceedings in another Member concerning alleged violation of that other Member&#8217;s laws and regulations on the subject matter of this Section shall, upon request, be granted an opportunity for consultations by the other Member under the same conditions as those foreseen in paragraph 3.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">PART III<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">SECTION 1: GENERAL OBLIGATIONS<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 41<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. Members shall ensure that enforcement procedures as specified in this Part are available under their law so as to permit effective action against any act of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this Agreement, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies which constitute a deterrent to further infringements. These procedures shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. Procedures concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be fair and equitable. They shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3. Decisions on the merits of a case shall preferably be in writing and reasoned. They shall be made available at least to the parties to the proceeding without undue delay. Decisions on the merits of a case shall be based only on evidence in respect of which parties were offered the opportunity to be heard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. Parties to a proceeding shall have an opportunity for review by a judicial authority of final administrative decisions and, subject to jurisdictional provisions in a Member&#8217;s law concerning the importance of a case, of at least the legal aspects of initial judicial decisions on the merits of a case. However, there shall be no obligation to provide an opportunity for review of acquittals in criminal cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">5. It is understood that this Part does not create any obligation to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general, nor does it affect the capacity of Members to enforce their law in general. Nothing in this Part creates any obligation with respect to the distribution of resources as between enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">SECTION 2: CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES AND REMEDIES<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 42<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Fair and Equitable Procedures<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Members shall make available to right holders civil judicial procedures concerning the enforcement of any intellectual property right covered by this Agreement. Defendants shall have the right to written notice which is timely and contains sufficient detail, including the basis of the claims. Parties shall be allowed to be represented by independent legal counsel, and procedures shall not impose overly burdensome requirements concerning mandatory personal appearances. All parties to such procedures shall be duly entitled to substantiate their claims and to present all relevant evidence. The procedure shall provide a means to identify and protect confidential information, unless this would be contrary to existing constitutional requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 43<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Evidence<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority, where a party has presented reasonably available evidence sufficient to support its claims and has specified evidence relevant to substantiation of its claims which lies in the control of the opposing party, to order that this evidence be produced by the opposing party, subject in appropriate cases to conditions which ensure the protection of confidential information.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. In cases in which a party to a proceeding voluntarily and without good reason refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide necessary information within a reasonable period, or signiimpedes a procedure relating to an enforcement action, a Member may accord judicial authorities the authority to make preliminary and final determinations, affirmative or negative, on the basis of the information presented to them, including the complaint or the allegation presented by the party adversely affected by the denial of access to information, subject to providing the parties an opportunity to be heard on the allegations or evidence.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 44<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Injunctions<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party to desist from an infringement, inter alia to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of imported goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right, immediately after customs clearance of such goods. Members are not obliged to accord such authority in respect of protected subject matter acquired or ordered by a person prior to knowing or having reasonable grounds to know that dealing in such subject matter would entail the infringement of an intellectual property right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Part and provided that the provisions of Part II specifically addressing use by governments, or by third parties authorized by a government, without the authorization of the right holder are complied with, Members may limit the remedies available against such use to payment of remuneration in accordance with subparagraph (h) of Article 31. In other cases, the remedies under this Part shall apply or, where these remedies are inconsistent with a Member&#8217;s law, declaratory judgments and adequate compensation shall be available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 45<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Damages<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered because of an infringement of that person\u2019s intellectual property right by an infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. The judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order the infringer to pay the right holder expenses, which may include appropriate attorney&#8217;s fees. In appropriate cases, Members may authorize the judicial authorities to order recovery of profits and\/or payment of pre-established damages even where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 46<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Other Remedies<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">In order to create an effective deterrent to infringement, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order that goods that they have found to be infringing be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm caused to the right holder, or, unless this would be contrary to existing constitutional requirements, destroyed. The judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order that materials and implements the predominant use of which has been in the creation of the infringing goods be, without compensation of any sort, disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimize the risks of further infringements. In considering such requests, the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement and the remedies ordered as well as the interests of third parties shall be taken into account. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit release of the goods into the channels of commerce.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 47<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Right of Information<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Members may provide that the judicial authorities shall have the authority, unless this would be out of proportion to the seriousness of the infringement, to order the infringer to inform the right holder of the identity of third persons involved in the production and distribution of the infringing goods or services and of their channels of distribution.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 48<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Indemnification of the Defendant<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to order a party at whose request measures were taken and who has abused enforcement procedures to provide to a party wrongfully enjoined or restrained adequate compensation for the injury suffered because of such abuse. The judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order the applicant to pay the defendant expenses, which may include appropriate attorney&#8217;s fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. In respect of the administration of any law pertaining to the protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights, Members shall only exempt both public authorities and officials from liability to appropriate remedial measures where actions are taken or intended in good faith in the course of the administration of that law.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 49<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Administrative Procedures<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, such procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set forth in this Section.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">SECTION 3: PROVISIONAL MEASURES<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Article 50<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to order prompt and effective provisional measures:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">(a) to prevent an infringement of any intellectual property right from occurring, and in particular to prevent the entry into the channels of commerce in their jurisdiction of goods, including imported goods immediately after customs clearance;<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">(b) to preserve relevant evidence in regard to the alleged infringement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to adopt provisional measures inaudita altera parte where appropriate, in particular where any delay is likely to cause irreparable harm to the right holder, or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">3. The judicial authorities shall have the authority to require the applicant to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy themselves with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant is the right holder and that the applicant\u2019s right is being infringed or that such infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">4. Where provisional measures have been adopted inaudita altera parte, the parties affected shall be given notice, without delay after the execution of the measures at the latest. A review, including a right to be heard, shall take place upon request of the defendant with a view to deciding, within a reasonable period after the notification of the measures, whether these measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">5. The applicant may be required to supply other information necessary for the identification of the goods concerned by the authority that will execute the provisional measures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">6. Without prejudice to paragraph 4, provisional measures taken on the basis of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall, upon request by the defendant, be revoked or otherwise cease to have effect, if proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case are not initiated within a reasonable period, to be determined by the judicial authority ordering the measures where a Member&#8217;s law so permits or, in the absence of such a determination, not to exceed 20 working days or 31 calendar days, whichever is the longer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">7. Where the provisional measures are revoked or where they lapse due to any act or omission by the applicant, or where it is subsequently found that there has been no infringement or threat of infringement of an intellectual property right, the judicial authorities shall have the authority to order the applicant, upon request of the defendant, to provide the defendant appropriate compensation for any injury caused by these measures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">8. To the extent that any provisional measure can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures, such procedures shall conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set forth in this Section.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">SECTION 4: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO BORDER MEASURES<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 51<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Suspension of Release by CustoAuthorities<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Members shall, in conformity with the provisions set out below, adopt procedures to enable a right holder, who has valid grounds for suspecting that the importation of counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods may take place, to lodge an application in writing with competent authorities, administrative or judicial, for the suspension by the customs authorities of the release into free circulation of such goods. Members may enable such an application to be made in respect of goods which involve other infringements of intellectual property rights, provided that the requirements of this Section are met. Members may also provide for corresponding procedures concerning the suspension by the customs authorities of the release of infringing goods destined for exportation from their territories.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 52<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Application<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Any right holder initiating the procedures under Article 51 shall be required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the laws of the country of importation, there is prima facie an infringement of the right holder\u2019s intellectual property right and to supply a sufficiently detailed description of the goods to make them readily recognizable by the customs authorities. The competent authorities shall inform the applicant within a reasonable period whether they have accepted the application and, where determined by the competent authorities, the period for which the customs authorities will take action.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 53<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Security or Equivalent Assurance<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">1. The competent authorities shall have the authority to require an applicant to provide a security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">2. Where pursuant to an application under this Section the release of goods involving industrial designs, patents, layout-designs or undisclosed information into free circulation has been suspended by customs authorities on the basis of a decision other than by a judicial or other independent authority, and the period provided for in Article 55 has expired without the granting of provisional relief by the duly empowered authority, and provided that all other conditions for importation have been complied with, the owner, importer, or consignee of such goods shall be entitled to their release on the posting of a security in an amount sufficient to protect the right holder for any infringement. Payment of such security shall not prejudice any other remedy available to the right holder, it being understood that the security shall be released if the right holder fails to pursue the right of action within a reasonable period of time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 54<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Notice of Suspension<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The importer and the applicant shall be promptly notified of the suspension of the release of goods according to Article 51.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Article 55<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Duration of Suspension<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If, within a period not exceeding 10 working days after the applicant has been served notice of the suspension, the customs authorities have not been informed that proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case have been initiated by a party other than the defendant, or that the duly empowered authority has taken provisional measures prolonging the suspension of the release of the goods, the goods shall be released, provided that all other conditions for importation or exportation have been complied with; in appropriate cases, this time-limit may be extended by another 10 working days. If proceedings leading to a decision on the merits of the case have been initiated, a review, including a right to be heard, shall take place upon request of the defendant with a view to deciding, within a reasonable period, whether these measures shall be modified, revoked or confirmed.
