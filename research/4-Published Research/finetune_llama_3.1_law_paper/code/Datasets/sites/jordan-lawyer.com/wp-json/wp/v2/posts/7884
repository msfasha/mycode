But there is exception to this principle, that is the worldwide reputation of a mark as a basis of extended protection.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Exception to specialty<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The principle of specialty stipulates that trademark can only be protected in relation to the same or similar goods or services covered by their registration or use.

Protection is afforded in relation to goods or services which are not similar provided that the use of the mark on such dissimilar goods or services would indicate a connection with the owner of registered trademark, and the interests of the registered trademark owner are likely to be damaged by such use.[1][5] Thus, the extended protection of the well-known trademarks to non-competing goods or services constitutes an exception to the principle of specialty.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Exception to registration<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0Both the Paris Convention and the TRIPS Agreement establish protection for well-known marks whether or not they are registered in the country in which the protection is sought.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, in the country where the prerequisite for protection is registration, the protection of the well-known trademark constitutes an exception to the principle of registration.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0 Well known marks in international treaties:<\/p>\n<ol dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><strong><em> Paris convention<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><em> TRIPS Agreement<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><em> WIPO Joint recommendation <\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><em> Paris convention<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Paris Convention includes provisions relating to the all-industrial property rights and establishes a set of uniform rules that must be observed by the member country of Union to provide minimum protection in the domestic legislation of the industrial property rights.

In order to solve these controversies, a number of countries have approached the WIPO to seek clarification on their obligations under the Paris Convention and the TRIPS, WIPO began to research this issue after the conclusion of the TRIPS Agreement. A special program was set up to study and determine the criteria for the definition of well-known trademarks under Article 6 bis of the Paris Convention and Article 16 of the TRIPS Agreement. The draft Provision on the Protection of Well-Known Marks have been considered by the WIPO Committee of Experts on Well-Known Marks, it recommends the Member State of the Paris Union or of WIPO to pay attention to protect the well-known marks in accordance, <em>mutatis mutandis<\/em> with the joint recommendation.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0The criteria to be a well-known mark under the Joint Recommendation<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 WIPO Committee of Experts on Well-Known Marks but the <strong>following factors:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0 1.the degree of knowledge or recognition of the mark in the relevant sector of the public.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0 2.the duration, extent, and geographical area of any use of the mark.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0 3.the duration, extent, and geographical area of any promotion of the mark, including advertising or publicity and the presentation, at fairs or exhibitions, of the goods and services to which the mark applies.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0 4.the duration and geographical area of any registration, and \/or any applications for registration, of the mark, to the extent that they reflect use or recognition of the mark.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0 5.the record of successful enforcement of rights in the mark, in particular, the extent to which the mark was recognized as well-known by competent authorities.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0 6.the value associated with the mark.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks, Determination whether a mark is well known in member state, the competent authority shall take into account any circumstances from which it may be inferred that the mark is well known.

this addition in because the competent minister can issue a regulation without this provision also, he is obliged to respect the agreements by the constitutional law.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"
