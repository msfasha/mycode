The challenge shall take place prior to or at the commencement of the trial. In exceptional circumstances, the Court may grant leave for a challenge to be brought more than once or at a time later than the commencement of the trial. Challenges to the admissibility of a case, at the commencement of a trial, or subsequently with the leave of the Court, may be based only on article 17, paragraph 1 (c).<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">5.A State referred to in paragraph 2 (b) and (c) shall make a challenge at the earliest opportunity.<\/p>\n<p style=\"direction: ltr;\">6.Prior to the confirmation of the charges, challenges to the admissibility of a case or challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court shall be referred to the Pre-Trial Chamber.
