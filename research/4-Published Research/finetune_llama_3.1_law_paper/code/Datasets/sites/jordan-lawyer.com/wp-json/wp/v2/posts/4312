Yet, they may not actually practice law. They often give legal advice. By attending law school in the United States, one can be considered a lawyer. A student of law must pass the bar exam in their authority to practice law by providing legal representation. Otherwise, the opportunities to use their law education are limited.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">An attorney at law or attorney-at-law is typically abbreviated to attorney in everyday conversation. An attorney is considered the official name for a lawyer in the United States. The first known use of the term attorney-at-law was in 1768.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">An attorney-at-law is defined as a practitioner in a court of law who is legally qualified to prosecute and defend actions in such court on the retainer of clients. The English word\u00a0<em>attorney<\/em> has French origins, meaning \u201ca person acting for another as an agent or deputy.\u201d An attorney practices law in court whereas a lawyer may or may not. An attorney has passed the\u00a0bar exam\u00a0and has been approved to practice law in his authority.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Although the terms often operate as synonyms, an attorney is a lawyer, but a lawyer is not necessarily an attorney. To the public, these terms may be used interchangeably but to the American Bar Association, the slight distinction is signific<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">What is the difference between lawyer and attorney in Jordan?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In Jordan, the terms &#8220;lawyer&#8221; and &#8220;attorney&#8221; are often used interchangeably and generally refer to the same profession. Both terms refer to a legal professional who is licensed to practice law and represent clients in legal matters.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">However, there is a slight difference between the two terms in terms of their origins. The term &#8220;lawyer&#8221; comes from the Latin word &#8220;legis,&#8221; which means law, while &#8220;attorney&#8221; comes from the Old French word &#8220;atorne,&#8221; which means to appoint.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In practice, lawyers and attorneys in Jordan provide legal services in a similar manner. They may represent clients in court, offer legal advice, draft legal documents, negotiate on behalf of clients, and perform other legal services.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Overall, the terms &#8220;lawyer&#8221; and &#8220;attorney&#8221; are generally used interchangeably in Jordan and refer to the same profession.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">What is a counsel in Jordan?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In the Jordanian legal system, a counsel is typically a legal advisor or consultant who provides expert advice to clients on legal matters. A counsel may or may not be a licensed lawyer or attorney, but they have a deep understanding of the law and legal procedures.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Counsels in Jordan may provide legal advice to individuals, businesses, government entities, or other organizations. They may also represent clients in legal proceedings or act as arbitrators or mediators to resolve disputes outside of court.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">While counsels in Jordan do not necessarily have the same level of authority as licensed lawyers or attorneys, their opinions and advice can be highly valuable in helping clients navigate legal issues and make informed decisions. In many cases, counsels work closely with lawyers or attorneys to provide comprehensive legal services to clients.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Jordan Law firm<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Our Jordan Law Office was Founded in 2001, and from the legal point of view, Amman, Jordan, was considered one of the first Arab cities of law practice which consist of mor than 2500 law offices .<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Law firm number in Jordan<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">How to get A Jordanian law firm\u00a0 phone number ,\u00a0 in Jordan you can get all the contacts of lawyer or law office through the bar association .<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">How to get a Jordanian law firm phone number?<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">In some cases, you may need help to get help to obtain a specific advice in any legal matter ,<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">To obtain the phone number for a Jordanian law firm, you can take the following steps:<\/p>\n<ol dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Conduct an online search: Use search engines like Google to search for law firms in Jordan.

The Embassy strongly recommends that persons with legal questions or difficulties consult a Jordanian attorney. (The Embassy has compiled a list of some attorneys in Jordan whom you may wish to contact).<\/p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Jordanian constitution<\/h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">The Jordanian constitution establishes the judiciary as one of three separate and independent branches of government. Jordan&#8217;s present legal system is based on the Constitution, the Court Establishment Law of 1951, a civil and criminal code plus Islamic and ecclesiastical laws in certain cases. Its legal system has been influenced by many sources. The system developed from codes of law instituted by the Ottoman Empire (based on French law). These were supplemented by British laws during the mandate period. Islamic law has also been influential, modifying in many ways the European models.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Two points need to be kept in mind by American citizens. First, the American and Jordanian legal systems, while similar in some respects, are not identical. This is not to suggest the system here is unjust, but that the two systems are based on differing societies and traditions. Second, American laws and judicial orders have no legal basis in Jordan (though a Jordanian court might decide to consider them). The same holds true about the effect of Jordanian laws and decisions in the United States.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jordan-lawyer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/Best-Law-Firm-in-Jordan-1.webp?ssl=1\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68243 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jordan-lawyer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/Best-Law-Firm-in-Jordan-1.webp?resize=1200%2C675&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jordan-lawyer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/Best-Law-Firm-in-Jordan-1.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jordan-lawyer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/Best-Law-Firm-in-Jordan-1.webp?resize=450%2C253&amp;ssl=1 450w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jordan-lawyer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/Best-Law-Firm-in-Jordan-1.webp?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/jordan-lawyer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/Best-Law-Firm-in-Jordan-1.webp?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><!-- \/wp:image&nbsp;--><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Best Law Firm in Jordan Looking for the best law firm in Jordan to help you navigate your legal challenges?
