It depends on incorporation within a particular country, acquires its nationality, and at the same time conducts its business in a country other than the country of incorporation. To benefit from the advantages and legislation of this country in which it conducts its business, the reason for the emergence of this type of company is due to several legal, social, political, or economic circumstances related to the nature of the work of the company or the persons of the partners themselves, and offshore companies enjoy the ease of moving their capital and getting out of the problems Double taxation. In this article, we will discuss everything about offshore companies through the following main elements:<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Defining the Offshore company:<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is called an &#8220;offshore company&#8221;, which means the company overseas or offshore, and this term is used to denote companies that are established in a particular country and conduct their business in another country.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">(Article 211) of the Jordanian Companies Law defines offshore companies as: \u201ca public joint stock company, a partnership limited by shares, a limited liability company, or a private joint stock company, registered in the Kingdom, and carrying out its business outside it, and the phrase (offshore company) added to its name.\u201d The system stipulated that the name of the company and all its publications should be added to the word \u201coffshore company\u201d, and this was confirmed by what was stated in (Article 5) of the offshore companies system, including: \u201cThe name of the offshore company must be accompanied by the phrase (offshore company), and its name should be included Its registration number and address on all papers and publications that it uses in its business and in the contracts it concludes, including certificates of ownership of shares or shares issued by it.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The system also prohibited this company from offering its shares for subscription in the Kingdom, as stipulated in Paragraph (b) of (Article 211) of the Companies Law: \u201cB- The offshore company is prohibited from offering its shares for subscription in the Kingdom.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The system also stipulated that the number of Jordanian employees should not be less than half of the total number of employees in this company, according to what was stipulated (Article 8) of the Offshore Companies Law: \u201cThe number of Jordanians working for an offshore company in the Kingdom may not be less than half of the total number of employees in it.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The offshore company in Jordanian law<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">These companies can be public joint stock, private joint stock, or limited liability, and they are registered as a Jordanian company in accordance with the law, and their business outside Jordan ceases, and the phrase \u201coffshore\u201d is added to their name.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Article (211) of the Jordanian Companies Law, the offshore company (the thousand shores) is a public joint stock company, a partnership limited by shares, a limited liability company, or a private joint stock company that is registered in Jordan and conducts business abroad.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The phrase (offshore company) must be added to its name, but according to Article (4) of the Offshore Companies Law of 2007, the offshore company must be committed to working within the purposes for which it was established and not to exercise any of its objectives inside Jordan and to have a clear physical headquarters in Jordan .<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The difference between the offshore company and the Jordanian company\u2019s branch abroad, is that the offshore company is registered in the Kingdom and conducts its business outside the Kingdom, so that it has a \u201cheadquarters\u201d management office only inside the Kingdom.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is an out boarder Company?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The term out boarder \u00a0company is used to describe a company in at least one of two ways:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A company or other type of legal entity that is incorporated or registered in an offshore financial center, tax haven, or<br \/>\nA company or group of companies (or sometimes a division of it) that engages in manufacturing or services business outside the borders of the country.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The term \u201coffshore\u201d linguistically means \u201coffshore\u201d and refers to licensing the company in a particular country, while it carries out business in another country. For example, an English shipping company can license an offshore company in the Republic of Panama to own ships and raise the flag of Panama so that it avoids paying Exorbitant taxes on its business and its activity outside England.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Second: The characteristics of offshore companies<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Due to the different companies offshore from other companies, they have a set of characteristics and advantages that distinguish them from other companies, and these characteristics and advantages are as follows:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1- Tax advantages:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is one of the most important advantages of offshore companies that are defined as tax haven companies, as they are offshore from tax in the country of their establishment, in addition to the fact that their partners seek to conduct their business in countries with a moderate tax system. In addition, this type of company usually saves the investor from issues of double taxation between the state of registration and the state of work.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2- Confidentiality:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some investors and businessmen seek to hide their investments or hide their names and use offshore companies as a means; To access their purposes granted to them by these companies with ease, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct their business and investments.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- <strong>Protection<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whereas economic legislation &#8211; in the countries in which investors conduct their business through offshore companies &#8211; guarantees investors the application of the company&#8217;s nationality law; Therefore, they enjoy asset protection for their business in the countries in which they do business.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4- Ease of registration and no approvals required:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Offshore companies are registered in Jordan in a similar way in terms of provisions and procedures in the same way in the British Islands such as Seychelles, British Virgin Islands, Cayman, Belize, and others, except that the fees are a little high, especially that there is a warranty \u00a0amount of 5000 dinars equivalent to 7100 US dollars, noting that this amount is refundable. After closing the company, there are no conditions or complications for the offshore company in Jordan, and bank accounts can be opened in all Jordanian banks.<br \/>\nThird: The difference between the offshore company and the branch of the Jordanian company abroad.<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Offshore company vs foreign branch:<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many individuals make the mistake of not distinguishing between the offshore company and the branch of the Jordanian company outside the Kingdom, and the difference between them is clear that the offshore company is registered in the Kingdom and conducts its business outside the Kingdom, so that it has a headquarters only inside the Kingdom, through which it manages some administrative work without commercial, but A branch of a Jordanian company located outside the Kingdom is affiliated with a company registered in the Kingdom and carries out its business within the Kingdom.<br \/>\nThe difference is not limited to the way the offshore company and the Jordanian company\u2019s branch operates abroad and the legal personality of each of them, but there is another difference in terms of taxation, as the offshore company is offshore from income tax according to what it decided (Article 4 \/ c \/ 3) of the Income Tax Law No. (34) for the year 2014, including: \u201cThe income of each of the following persons and entities shall be offshored from tax, provided that the terms and conditions related to this offshoring are determined by virtue of a regulation issued for this purpose: \u2026 The offshore company registered under the Companies Law, and which is derived from it from conducting its business outside the Kingdom, with the exception of Income derived from the sources of income that are subject to tax under this law.<br \/>\nAs for the branch of the Jordanian company located outside the Kingdom, the partners in the company have the right to add a new branch to the company\u2019s center according to its memorandum of association and articles of association, and it has the right to open branches inside and outside the Kingdom. The income of the branch, which is inside and outside the Kingdom, is subject to income tax in accordance with the provisions of (Article 3 \/ c) of Income Tax Law No. (34) of 2014 AD, as stated: \u201cSubject to tax:<br \/>\nThe net income achieved by the resident person from any source outside the Kingdom, provided that it resulted from funds or deposits from the Kingdom, the total net income achieved by the branch of the Jordanian company operating outside the Kingdom and announced in its final financial statements certified by an external chartered accountant.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fourth: Procedures for Offshore Companies<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this part, we show all the procedures for private joint stock and limited liability offshore companies, starting from the mechanism of their registration until reaching their write-off or liquidation, as follows:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1- Offshore company registration mechanism<\/strong><br \/>\nThe Offshore Companies Law has clarified the method of registering offshore companies, by submitting an application to register the offshore company to the Controller, by filling out the form prepared for that purpose, attaching the Memorandum of Association and its articles of association, and a statement of the company\u2019s type and objectives.
