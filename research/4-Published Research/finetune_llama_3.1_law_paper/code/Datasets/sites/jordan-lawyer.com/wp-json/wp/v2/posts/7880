With the increasing use of licensing as a means of growing their businesses, manufacturing business owners are increasingly facing decisions of whether to obtain a trademark license to create branded products.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0Critical to those decisions are the important legal issues and concerns governing the relationship between the owner of the trademark and other licensed material \u2013 the licensor \u2013 and the business owner obtaining the right to use the trademark \u2013 the licensee \u2013 that are set forth in the license agreement they negotiate.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0The licensor and licensee approach the license agreement from two different perspectives. On the one hand, the licensor seeks to leverage its brand and generate additional profit through royalties without being required to expand its own operations, while seeking to protect and retain strict control over its valuable intellectual property. On the other hand, the licensee seeks to gain the right to use the licensed material to enhance the marketability of its own products and to increase its own profit potential upon reasonable financial and other terms.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0in Jordan, the Jordanian Civil Code provides general principle which apply on intellectual property rights copyright, patent, \u2026 and trademarks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Article 67 from Jordan Civil Code classified rights into personal, real, and incorporeal. personal right exist when there is a legal relationship between a debtor and creditor by virtue of which the creditor claims from the debtor the transfer of real right or the execution, or non-execution of the work[1].\u00a0 Incorporeal rights were defined as rights attached to non-material things , for example\u00a0 copyright, patent,\u00a0 trademark, and other moral rights which are governed\u00a0 by special laws[2] .<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Part one<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1.1 Defining the trademark license:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A trademark is the brand under which a business sells goods and services. The mark is a device that conveys to the buyer some level of quality or indication of service level, which over a period acquires identity separate to that of the goods and services upon which it is applied. In this way, this brand adopted by a business portrays represents the image which customers of a business rely upon in selecting goods and services \u2013 it is an association with the brand.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Growing businesses looking to expand the markets in which the company\u2019s goods or services are sold in and increase market share can secure their branding rights, protect their brand name, distribution agreements or advertising arrangements.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trademarks are private property, and thus may be dealt with like any other property. The rights granted by the Trademarks Act allow trademark owners to prevent others selling goods or services using their \u00a0trademark without their permission. To do so would be an infringement. It is the licensing of the use of a trademark in association with a certain quality of goods and services that allows companies to create additional revenue streams by exploiting their trade name in combination with other businesses that see the value in an association in approaching a market.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Permission in these arrangements therefore is entirely in the discretion of the trademark proprietor &#8211; to allow a business to sell goods and services and use the registered trademark in conjunction with them. This is the essence of licensing trademarks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The term &#8220;trademark licensing&#8221; is a fairly wide expression, which can exist under various forms of contractual relationships, A trademark licensing agreement is a complex matter. Many economical, commercial, marketing, and legal issues must be considered in discussing and finalizing such an Agreement.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Legally it is defined as an agreement whereby the trademark owner authorizes another person or persons to use a mark. A trademark license usually, but not necessarily, contains several conditions such as exclusiveness, consideration, quality standards, the way in which the trademark may be used and advertised, territorial scope, provision of models, patterns, or samples.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I define the \u201ctrademark licensing\u201d as any contractual arrangement wherein the owner of a trademark licenses its mark to another, usually, but not necessarily, for a fee. Under the agreement, the licensee then has a contractual right to produce and sell goods bearing the licensor\u2019s mark.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A licensor defines as:<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>A person who grants <\/em>a person with exclusive legal rights over a thing or, acting as agent for the\u00a0owner, gives, sells or otherwise surrenders to another a limited right to use that thing[3].<\/p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A licensee:<\/h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0The recipient or beneficiary of a license to use something, A person to whom a license has been granted to use someone else&#8217;s specified thing such as a building, a piece of land or intellectual property a person benefiting from the grant is called a licensee and the legal term used to describe the authority so given, a license.[4]<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I define the Licensee\u201d the person to whom the licensor grants a license to exploit the licensor\u2019s trademark.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2 Differentiate between trademark license and closer legal acts.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is important to differentiate between trademark license and another legal matters which sometimes have an overlap with trademark license, like franchising, assignment of trademark, and the technology transfer.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1.2.1 Trademark license and franchising\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A trademark license can be defined as an agreement whereby the trademark owner authorizes another person or persons to use a mark. A trademark license usually, but not necessarily, contains several conditions such as exclusiveness, consideration, quality standards, the way in which the trademark may be used and advertised, territorial scope, provision of models, patterns, or samples.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">While franchise can be described as a method of distributing goods and services through independently operated business that shows a common identity to the public.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is a difference between a franchise agreement and a trademark license. A franchise is mostly considered as an agreement aiming at exploiting marketing plans or systems. From a legal point of view, it should be noted that most franchise agreements contain a trademark license, but this is not necessary. A franchise agreement may be restricted to licenses of names, trade dress, house style, etc. Franchise agreements contain the obligation by the franchisor to provide technical and\/or commercial knowledge and\/or assistance, whereas this is not always the case in a trademark license. Although many trademark license agreements will contain an obligation by the licensee to fulfill certain quality requirements with respect to the manufacture and\/or sale of goods and\/or supply of services, such requirements are typical elements of a franchise agreement[5].<\/p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main deference can be summarized in the following:[6]<\/h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">1-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Royalty<\/strong>: In licensing the royalties are paid to the licensor while the royalty in franchise called management fees which are paid to the franchisor.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">2-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Subject of contract<\/strong>: the subject of the license contract only the trademark or trademarks to use on a product or services, while the franchise covers the total business, sometimes it includes knowledge, trademarks, business contacts, products prices, and other intellectual property rights.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">3-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>The strength of the licensee and the franchisee<\/strong>: in the license the licensee is usually a well-established business or at less it is an independent establishment, but in franchise franchisee is often tends to be a start-up operation, or at less the franchisee is dependent on the franchisor in initial issues. Moreover, the licensee often tends to be self-selecting and he has a strong position to execute the license, while in franchise the franchisee is mostly selected by the franchisor.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">4-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>The duration<\/strong> <strong>of the contract<\/strong>: mostly the duration of the license agreement ten years and renewed, while it is about five years in the franchise agreement.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">5-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>The negotiability:<\/strong> in license agreement the licensee negotiate the royalty and other important matters based on his market presence, while in franchise the franchisor have standard, nonnegotiable fee structure, and another critical issues.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">6-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <strong>Applicable law<\/strong>: in trademark license the applicable law is trademark law and the related laws of the trademark like goods mark law, while in franchise there are multiple laws to be apply to this contract like trademark law, trade secret law, patent, anti-competitive practice law, etc.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1.2.2- Trademark license and trademark assignment:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A trademark license is an agreement in which the owner of a mark grants another party a limited right to use the mark on specified goods and \\ or services in each territory for a specific time, the licensor continue to own the trademark, and use of the mark by the licensee inures to the benefit of the licensor.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">An assignment of a trademark is an agreement where the owner of a trademark transfers all or a portion of his\/her rights in the trademark to another party. This form is designed for the transfer of all the rights in the mark, meaning that the owner, after executing the assignment, will no longer have any rights in and to the mark.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the absence of any provision to the contrary in the license contract, the grant of a license does not prevent the registered proprietor from granting further licenses to third parties or from using the trade or service mark himself. The grant of an exclusive license will prevent the registered proprietor from granting further licenses to third parties and from using the trade or service mark himself. In the absence of any provision to the contrary in the license contract, the registered user will be entitled to use the trade or service mark during the whole duration of registration, including renewals, in the entire country, and in respect of all the goods or services for which the trade or service mark is registered, subject to any conditions or limitations entered in the register[7].<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">A license, unlike an assignment, does not require or operate to transfer the ownership of the licensor trademark. In a trademark license , the licensees right in the mark are inherently limited, and the licensor has continuing obligations , like maintaining and policing the mark.[8]<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Assignment of a trademark is possible under Jordanian trademark legislation. A mark may be assigned in whole or in part (i.e., for some of the goods or services for which it is registered). Recorded of an assignment is mandatory.<\/p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>1.2.3- Technology Transfer and Licensing of Intellectual Property Rights<\/strong><strong>[9]<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">&#8220;The phrase \u201ctechnology transfer\u201d is frequently used but not well understood. The phrase refers to moving technology from one party to another. Although training, teaching or instruction on any subject can be considered the transfer of technology, typically \u201ctechnology transfer\u201d involves moving rights of intangible intellectual property protected by a patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark between parties, by granting a license. &#8221; The licensing of rights in intellectual property is the \u201ctechnology transfer\u201d discussed in this chapter.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Licensing is the process by which the right to use intangible intellectual property is granted by one party to another. The rights in intangible intellectual property that can be licensed include, among other things, the right to use, copy, display, perform, develop, make, manufacture, market, sell or distribute the property being licensed. Because the license does not transfer title, it is not a sale of the intellectual property, and the owner retains those rights in the intellectual property it has not licensed exclusively to another party. The license is a promise by the owner not to sue the party using the intellectual property for infringement or for use without the owner\u2019s permission.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Part Two<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>licensee Rights and obligations in trademark licensing:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trademark Licensing is an authorization by the proprietor granting to another person the right to exploit his trademark, either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis.

A corollary to this \u201cright to exclude &#8221; is the trademark owners&#8217; right to permit others to use their marks under specific conditions. Usually, permission is achieved by contracts , which are defined as &#8221; licensing agreements&#8221; or &#8220;trademark licenses &#8221; as with any other type of agreements , trademark licenses can contain a variety of clauses including conditions such as exclusiveness, territorial scope, advertising, quality standards, and the percentage and frequency of royalties due to the licensor.[10]<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trademark is a contract between the licensor and the licensee, this contract contains a several conditions, these conditions will govern the relation between them also it determines the right and obligations of each party.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jordan trademark law didn\u2019t mention the types of trademark license agreement also didn\u2019t specify the conditions of the license agreement , because the license is a contract in Jordan Law its governed by the civil code as it is contain the general rule .[11]<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In Jordan civil code the two parties can agree in any condition or conditions shall not be contrary to public order or morality.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Jordanian trademark law No.34 of the year1999 stated in article 25 paragraph 2 and 3:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>2- The trademark owner may license one or more persons, under a notarized contract to be filed with the Registrar, to use the mark for all or some of the goods.

It is the licensee who is operating on a market, where the licensor might not be present at all. Therefore, license agreement often states that the licensee has the duty to inform the licensor about infringements.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next question is, who, the licensor, the licensee, or both together, can and must, take what action?<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0If not specifically regulated in the agreement, this question depends on the type of the license. In the case of a non-exclusive license the licensor must act. In the case of an exclusive license, the licensee must take the action. Irrespective of the license type, these aspects should be discussed by the parties and agreed upon in advance. For instance, the parties might agree to a contract stating that at first the licensor has to act, but if he refrains, then the licensor is automatically entitled, but not obliged, to act in his own name.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0Legal disputes are expensive, and therefore it is frequently wise to regulate the division of the costs of disputes in the agreement.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jordan trademark law didn\u2019t regulate \u00a0this manner in trademark law, there are no articles regulate the case of legal dispute against a third party if he is a defendant ,plaintiff , this issue is governed by the general rules of Jordan\u00a0\u00a0 procedure law \u00a0, which in civil cases the person who can make a case he shall has a legal interest in the case , so the licensee has the legal interest and the financial interest\u00a0 in this issue , in addition \u00a0Any person can make\u00a0 legal action in the trademark registration stage by make an objection to the registrar[14]. The situation is vary in appeal stage that just the person who has a personal legal interest can make an appeal to the High court of justice[15].<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0Moreover, in criminal cases the licensor who has the right to take the action.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, legal disputes often arise out of an attack by third parties on the trademarks addressed in the agreement. This attack could be to cancellation or opposition proceedings. Also, court actions might be brought by a third party, who claims that the use of the licensed TM is infringing the third party\u2019s rights. In this case, it is usually the licensee who will have to bear the consequences of the attack, because he is using the TM. In discussing the agreement, the licensee might therefore request a warranty by the licensor in the trade license agreement stating that the use of the licensed TM is not infringing any third party rights[16].<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The licensee has the right to make a case against the infringer based on the unfair competition which gives the right to any interested party to make a case against any unfair act infringer, so the license has the right to make this case.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imitation suitcase against third party the licensee cannot take such act against the infringer, the only thing that he should tell the licensor about the infringement thin the licensor should take the legal action by sue the infringer in imitation suitcase.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2.2.

(37) OF 1992 Concerning trademark article 34 stated:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>A licensing contract may not contain any stipulations binding a license beneficiary with restrictions not imposed on the rights granted by the registration of a trademark or not necessary for preserving such right.

Accordingly, exceptional care should be taken to craft quality control provisions that maintain the value of the mark, while allowing the licensee the ability to operate its business as it deems appropriate.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Quality control provisions should be designed to ensure that any products or services offered under the licensed trademark are of a quality that is at least equal to, if not better than, any existing products or services offered by the licensor. Quality control provisions should also include strict guidelines for use of the licensed trademark, which should specifically describe how and where to affix the mark. In addition, quality control provisions should set forth clear and unambiguous product specifications and should describe adequate product inspection and approval procedures. Similarly, quality control provisions should specify that the licensor has the right to routinely inspect the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the license agreement and applicable laws. A licensor should also demand the right to review customer service comments and complaints.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In my research I talk about the rights and obligations of the licensee in Jordan trademark law in comparison with the United Arab Emirates federal trademark law, I found that Jordan law talk about license agreement in brief only in article 25 , this article make the basement of licensing that make the possibility of licensing the trademark without the goodwill, this article establish the possibility of exclusive and non-exclusive license , in addition that the new amendment in 2008 which added to the article stipulate the duration of the license for the term of protection , with conjunction with article 20 paragraph 2 the term of protection is ten years , for that the term of the license shall not exceed ten years in Jordan law, for me I see that the new amendment is cruel to the licensee because after the ten years he need another license in another conditions which may grant the licensor the chance to impose unjust conditions upon the licensee shoulders to renew the license.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In United Arab Emirates the license agreement is regulated in the articles from 30 to 34, the provisions are much detailed than the Jordanian provisions, but it is the same rules at the end with little bed deference.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main issue which is not managed in the two laws the legal dispute action which it returns to general rule which contain a little vague about this issue which it is in the two countries is subject to discretionary comparing other jurisdictions like UK it is manage this issue in incredibly detailed provisions.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally in Jordan law there are nothing about quality control as a condition in the license agreement , which it is important to protect the consumer from buying the bad goods which they don\u2019t want , however in UAE trademark law this condition is optional in the license agreement, this condition is an important matter which in USA for example it shall be contained in the license agreement contrary to this the trademark owner well lose his trademark, because of that I see that Jordanian legislator need to make an amendment stipulate the quality control condition.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">1- Alshafi, Ayman Abdullah. thesis, Arbitration in International Business Contracts, KingAbdul-AzizUniversity, KSA<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">2- Dr. Utz Kador, Kador \u201cTHE TRADEMARK LICENSING A GREEMENT\u201d (TLA), Munich, 10\/2004<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">3- Friderick Abbott, Thomas cottier and Francis Gurry, The international intellectual property system.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a04- Jay Dratler, Jr, Licensing of Intellectual Property, Law Journal Press, 2006 page 7.12.1<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">5- Izaz Ali, Licensing provisions: Overview, 12 January 2005, article\u00a0 , lawdit reading room, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lawdit.co.uk\/reading_room\/room\/view_article.asp?name=\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.lawdit.co.uk\/reading_room\/room\/view_article.asp?name=<\/a>..\/articles\/Licensing%20provisions.htm<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">6- David Kitchin and others, Kerly\u2019s Law of Trademarks and Tradenames, published by Sweet and Maxwell, thirteen editions.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">7- PETER K.
